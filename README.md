# Col_mo_spp
Two files for different simulations for collective motions of self-propelled particles

1. col_mo_with_ca_cp.py
The potential function is active in the decelerating range, and is normalized as a parabolic function.

2. col_mo_equ_point.py
The potential function is active in whole sensing range, and is normalized as a parabolic function with an equilibrium point.
